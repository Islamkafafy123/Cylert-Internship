# 1) Injection
- all about injecting SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP into the application. It can be as SQL queries through the input interface of the application. Successful SQL injection can lead to sensitive data from the database being exposed.
- occurs when data is inserted into a program from an untrusted source because of the lack of input validation and data sanitization, which can directly expose input into the query
- Injection Mitigation :
  - use of Prepared Statements with Parameterized queries
  - use of Stored Procedures
  - Implement input validation and sanitization
  - escaping all user-supplied input
# 2) Broken Authentication
- Ex :Session Time-out, Credential Stuffing
- where attackers exploit to impersonate a legitimate user online
- always in two areas: session management and credential management because either of these two can be used to hijacked session IDs or can steal login credentials
- Your web application has a broken authentication if it does the following :
  - Allows automated attacks such as brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries different usernames and passwords to carry out an attack
  - Allows default and weak passwords. Example: password, admin
  - Allows a weak credential recovery system or forgot password workaround
  - Allows a weak credential recovery system or forgot password workaround
  - No multi-factor authentication system is in place
  - If your session ID gets exposed in the URL
  - If it fails to renew session ID each time for a new session
  - If it fails to kill every session ID or tokens after application log out or after the time specified for inactivity expired
- Broken Authentication Mitigation:
  - Making use of captcha.
  - Reduce the number of tries for a particular user based on the session ID or the IP
  - Blocking multiple requests coming from the same IP
  - Making the admin login page inaccessible to the public
  - Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent brute-forcing and credential theft
# 3) Sensitive Data Exposure
- Example: Unencrypted data
- known as information disclosure or information leakage. This usually occurs when an application or website unknowingly discloses sensitive data to users who do not have the privilege of view or access
- these are some of the information that may get leaked to the public:
  - Financial information
  - Login credentials
  - Commercial or business data
  - Health record
  - Technical details about the application or website.
- Sensitive Data Exposure Mitigation:
  - Always identify and classify which data is sensitive according to the privacy laws and the regulatory requirements
  - Immediately remove any data that is not needed to be stored
  - If you are going to be store any sensitive data, make sure it is encrypted at rest
  - Make sure you encrypt all data in transit with security protocols such as TLS and SSL
  - Do not cache sensitive data
  - Always store passwords with different encryption methods
# 4) XXE Injection
- Example: File Retrieval, Blind XXE
- security vulnerability that gives a malicious user access to an application that processes XML data or parses XML input
- When this vulnerability is successfully exploited, it allows an attacker to view files on the application server and to interact with any other back end or external system that the application can access
- XXE attack can further be escalated to compromise other back-end or underlying servers through Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks
- the actual vulnerability lies in the way the XML is parsed
- XXE Injection Mitigation:
  - must disable DTD and XML external entity features
  - All the XML processors and libraries used within the application must always be updated and patched
  - Use good XML parsers that are not vulnerable by default
  - Make use of a very good SAST tool that can help detect XXE in your source code
  - Make sure XML and XSL file upload functionality validates every incoming XML by using XSD validation
  - Make use of API security gateways
  - Make use of WAF
  - You can start making use of JSON data format, which is less complex
# 5) Broken Access Control
