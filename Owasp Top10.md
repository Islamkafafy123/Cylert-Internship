# 1) Injection
- all about injecting SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP into the application. It can be as SQL queries through the input interface of the application. Successful SQL injection can lead to sensitive data from the database being exposed.
- occurs when data is inserted into a program from an untrusted source because of the lack of input validation and data sanitization, which can directly expose input into the query
- Injection Mitigation :
  - use of Prepared Statements with Parameterized queries
  - use of Stored Procedures
  - Implement input validation and sanitization
  - escaping all user-supplied input
# 2) Broken Authentication
- Ex :Session Time-out, Credential Stuffing
- where attackers exploit to impersonate a legitimate user online
- always in two areas: session management and credential management because either of these two can be used to hijacked session IDs or can steal login credentials
- Your web application has a broken authentication if it does the following :
  - Allows automated attacks such as brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries different usernames and passwords to carry out an attack
  - Allows default and weak passwords. Example: password, admin
  - Allows a weak credential recovery system or forgot password workaround
  - Allows a weak credential recovery system or forgot password workaround
  - No multi-factor authentication system is in place
  - If your session ID gets exposed in the URL
  - If it fails to renew session ID each time for a new session
  - If it fails to kill every session ID or tokens after application log out or after the time specified for inactivity expired
- Broken Authentication Mitigation:
  - Making use of captcha.
  - Reduce the number of tries for a particular user based on the session ID or the IP
  - Blocking multiple requests coming from the same IP
  - Making the admin login page inaccessible to the public
  - Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent brute-forcing and credential theft
